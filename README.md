# GPasT
GPT for Pascal code generation :)

## Required dependencies
If you want to run the project locally. Here are the required dependencies that you have to download

```
// From HuggingFace
tokenizers
transformers 
datasets

// Raw data collection
pygithub
```

## Running the model
You can run it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/buckdan/GPasT), [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Falcon2006VN/GPasT-small-model) or locally if you preferred.<br>

**For locally you have to run the script in this order**
1.raw_data.py
2.clean.py
3.preprocess.py
4.

## Usage
This Pascal AI code generation can be use for simple code generation. Currently my setup can only train small models (20 batch size of data on Google Colab)<br>
So this AI won't propably has many improvements.<br>
I also only creating this to put in my portfolio :). But if I have a chance I will improve this AI...

## End
I you download this repo for some reasons and use this AI instead of ChatGPT or Github Copilot... I guessed thank you...
